## AntigenWechatBot
AntigenWechatBot is a wechat bot that collects antigen information of daily antigen testing during the Pandamic in Shanghai.

## Story:
Currently in our neighbourhood we are required to have an antigen testing once or twice a day, and let every every neighbour to upload an image into a wechat group which contains all the people in this building. An administrator of this building need to collect all the images, and check if every single room has upload the required image and whether the antigen results are all negative, which is very time consuming.
    
## Demand:
An automatic wechat bot that significantly reduce the work the building administrator need to do, and require users' additional knowledge as less as possible.

## Plan:
# Phase 1:
An wechat bot that can collect all the images of a building, remind those people who have not yet uploaded the image, and generate a file for the building administrator to quickly check if all the results are negative. In this case, the administrator will only check a file with all the neighbours sorted, which will significantly reduce the time. On the other hand, in this situation, users will not have to learn further knowledge nor switch to another platform, which will help increase the users' adoption rate.
    
# Phase 2:
Add Computer Vision technologies into the wechat bot that can automatically do the job of the building administrator. In this case, no worker is needed in this system and all the process can be done automatically.
